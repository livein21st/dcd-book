# Roadmap

 It is more a guideline than a strict set of tasks we are bound to finish. We will adjust over this period depending on study results and collaboration opportunities.

At a high-level, the research focuses on the following four objectives:

* **Data** in every design process
* **Accountable** data and design process
* **Trustful** use and sharing of data
* **Involvement** of all stakeholders

How do we plan to tackle this? The how is broken down into the following sections which this roadmap will dive into:

* Platform and Innovation: The DCD Hub combines a set of innovative tools for effective and responsible design with data;
* Design Process Integration: It integrates design processes by supporting designers through their data-centric approach;
* Evaluation: It is a prototype that generates metrics to gain insights on data-centric design practices and evaluate new tools and methods;
* Education: It supports new and experienced designers through the use of data in design.

See [Quarterly Iteration Plans](https://github.com/datacentricdesign/dcd-hub/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)

## Platform and Innovation

The DCD Hub is a prototype of data platform to support designing with data.

### DCD Hub and the core system

* Cloud-native infrastructure
* Data streaming pipeline
* Fine-grain authentication and authorisation mechanism

A remote, web-based platform provides an easy getting started access that can be appropriately scalable and secured.

### Data as a material

* Minimalist data model
* Quantitative and qualitative data: sensors, documents, media
* Strongly typed, to facilitate support and automation

### Collection, Storage and Processing

* Standard prototyping languages, APIs and Platforms
* Personal data box: transparency and control over personal data
* Analytics registry: touch point for all stakeholders, peer-reviewed data analytics, support mechanism for bias
* Automated streaming analysis based on data type

## Design Process Integration

To inject data throughout the design process, we data tools and methods should be geared towards designers but also fit in the design thinking flow.

### Iterative Process

* Double Diamond: Discover, define, develop, deliver
* Collection moments
* Data Design Kits \(DDK\)

In contrast with typical Software Development Kits from computer engineering community, we aim to develop Data Design Kits \(DDK\).

* Fast access to real-time data collection and exploration

### Co-Design

* Real-time experience sampling
* Participatory data analysis

## Evaluation

Being a prototype, the DCD Hub generates metrics to measure its performance and inform its next iteration. It aims at addressing research questions such as:

* How can digital infrastructures balance values of data stakeholders?
* How can designer leverage data with confidence while data subject donate data with trust?
* How can design implement responsible data-centric design processes at scale?

Measurement mechanisms must take place to enable studies on these question. The approach will rely on logs, A/B testing and experience sampling. This involves the following metrics:

* Hub interaction: when, who, what
* Data sharing: how much is kept private, how much is shared? In which conditions?

## Education

While the DCD Hub is a prototype for understanding what tools and methods can support effective and responsible design with data, educating future designers is a key aspect of project.

* Documentation for designers
* Example-driven approach
* Prototyping kit
