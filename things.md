# Things



The next step is to get familiar with the DCD Hub, relying on three main concepts:

* A **Person** represents a physical person, signed up on the hub. It can own, share and have access to Things. A person has:
  * a email address \(its unique identifier\),
  * a name
  * a password \(at least 8 characters\)
* A **Thing** represents a physical or virtual component collecting data. For example, a phone which collects acceleration, a website recording number of page views. A Thing has:
  * an unique identifier \(or id\), automatically generated by the hub 
  * a name
  * a type \(optional\), to give a type to the Thing \(e.g. Phone, Wheelchair, Website\)
  * a description \(optional\)
  * a list of properties \(optional\) which values change over time
* A **Property** represents a Thing property
  * an unique identifier \(or id\), automatically generated by the hub 
  * a name
  * a type, which characterise the nature of the property and its number of

    dimensions \([See Property Types](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/docs/api.html#property-types)\)

  * a list of dimensions
  * a 2-dimension list of values, starting with a [UNIX TIMESTAMP](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)

    and followed by the value of each dimension. All values MUST be numbers.

```javascript
[
  ["UNIX timestamp", "value-dimension-1", "value-dimension-2"],
  ["UNIX timestamp", "value-dimension-1", "value-dimension-2"]
]
```

* a list of classes \(optional\): if the property type is 'CLASS', you can associate

  text to the values. This is useful when using a property as data label.
